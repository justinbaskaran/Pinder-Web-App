													Pinder Desktop Application

Software Engineering Project â€” You could re-engineer one of the software engineering projects as an SPA (rather than as an Android native application).

Vision: 
Make a web app that allows the user to list a pet and find a pet. The list a pet feature will allow the user to input form data that will create a dog object in our server on the database side. The find a pet feature will allow us to swipe through dogs and see if we like one, and if so give the owner's details about the dog.
